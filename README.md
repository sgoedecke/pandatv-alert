# Panda.tv alerter

A quick and dirty script to alert you when a streamer you like comes on panda.tv, since panda.tv doesn't seem to have a useable alert function of its own.

## Usage

You should just be able to double-click "main.py".

If that doesn't work for some reason, run it from the command line by typing `python main.py`. It'll beep if EternalEnvy or Arteezy start streaming.

## Dependencies

You'll need Python 2.7, but it should already be installed on Windows or Mac machines.
